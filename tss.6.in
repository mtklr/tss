.SH NAME
tss \- terminal screensaver
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtss\fP [\fIoptions\fP...] [\fB\-a\fP\ \fIfile\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtss\fP is a terminal screensaver for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.
.PP
The following options are available:
.TP
\fB\-a\fP\ \fIfile\fP,\ \fB\-\-ascii\fP=\fIfile\fP
Use ASCII file \fIfile\fP.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP\ \fIdelay\fP,\ \fB\-\-delay=\fP\fIdelay\fP
Update every \fIdelay\fP milliseconds.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP\ \fIspeed\fP,\ \fB\-\-uname\-speed=\fP\fIspeed\fP
Set uname speed to \fIspeed\fP (0.001 - 1.00).
.TP
\fB\-h\fP,\ \fB\-\-help\fP
Print a brief help message.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP\ \fIspeed\fP,\ \fB\-\-info\-speed=\fP\fIspeed\fP
Set info speed to \fIspeed\fP (0.001 - 1.00).
.\" .TP
.\"\fB\-l\fP,\ \fB\-\-lock\-terminal\fP
.\"Lock terminal.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP,\ \fB\-\-no\-mirror\fP
Disable ASCII mirroring.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP\ \fIspeed\fP,\ \fB\-\-object\-speed=\fP\fIspeed\fP
Set ASCII speed to \fIspeed\fP (0.001 - 1.00).
.TP
\fB\-r\fP,\ \fB\-\-random\fP
Choose a random ASCII file from \fI@datadir@\fP, or \fI~/.tss\fP if the former
path does not exist or contain any files.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP,\ \fB\-\-scrollbar\fP
Show load average in a scrollbar.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP,\ \fB\-\-version\fP
Print version information and exit.
.SH COLORS
Any character can be colored by prepending \fC<Esc>\fP plus a color value
before the character. The color will be set until an other color code is set.
If several escape sequences follow each other, the last seen is used.
.PP
Colors are standard VT120, as initialised by curses:
.IP
.nf
1. Red
2. Green
3. Black
4. Yellow
5. Blue
6. Magenta
7. Cyan
8. White
.fi
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\fC
^[5Hello,
^[4This is a demo^[8
\fP
.fi
.PP
This will make "Hello," blue, and "This is a demo" yellow.
.PP
Since the colors will "float" until an other color is interpreted, we can
manipulate the color of the uname and scrollbox from the ASCII. The \fC^[8\fP
at the end will make these objects white.
.PP
In order for color mirroring to work properly, make sure to repeat colors so
that they will be readable from both directions.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\fC
AAAA^[8^[2hello%[2^[8AAAA
\fP
.fi
.PP
This will make the text "hello" red in both directions.
.PP
The default color is 8 (white).
.SH ATTRIBUTES
Curses attributes like bold, underline, etc. are also supported by escape codes
followed by a letter. Uppercase turns on the attribute, lowercase turns it off:
.IP
.nf
A. Alternate character set
B. Bold
D. Dim
I. Invisible
K. Blink
N. Normal
P. Protect
R. Reverse
S. Standout
T. Bright
U. Underline
.fi
.PP
As with color mirroring, the attributes should be repeated on both sides of
each line so they are correct in either direction.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\fC
^[b^[B^[u^[Uevol^[U^[u^[B^[b
\fP
.fi
.PP
"Normal" turns off all attributes. Not all attributes are supported on all
systems.
.SH MIRRORING
\fBtss\fP can flip a buffer and correct characters which have substitutes for
the opposite direction. This usually turns out quite nicely with most ASCII
art.
.PP
\fBtss\fP supports automatic ASCII padding since v0.7.8.4, so there is no
longer any need to manually pad out ASCII with spaces in order for mirroring to
work properly.
.SH DIRECTION / NOMIRROR
If you want an ASCII file to start in a specific direction, you can do this by
prepending \fC<Esc>\fP plus the letter "l" or "r" after it in the beginning of
the file.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\fC
^[lThis is a demo
\fP
.fi
.PP
If you do not want the ASCII file to mirror at all, do the same as above but
with a "n" after \fC<Esc>\fP.
.\".SH LOCKING
.\".PP
.\"For locking (option \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-lock\-terminal\fP) to work, this
.\"program requires suid. To do so,
.\".IP
.\".nf
.\"\fC
.\"su
.\"make
.\"chmod 4555 tss
.\"exit
.\"\fP
.\".fi
.\".PP
.\"If \fBtss\fP is called with -l in a VT, it will not be possible to shut it down
.\"without entering the correct password.
.\".PP
.\"Be careful!
.SH NOTE
Please note that \fBtss\fP is discontinued and deemed unsafe.
